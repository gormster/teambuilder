/**
 * Library of functions and constants for module teambuilder
 * This file should have two well differenced parts:
 *   - All the core Moodle functions, neeeded to allow
 *     the module to work integrated in Moodle.
 *   - All the teambuilder specific functions, needed
 *     to implement all the module logic. Please, note
 *     that, if the module become complex and this lib
 *     grows a lot, it's HIGHLY recommended to move all
 *     these module specific functions to a new php file,
 *     called "locallib.php" (see forum, quiz...). This will
 *     help to save some memory when Moodle is performing
 *     actions across all modules.
